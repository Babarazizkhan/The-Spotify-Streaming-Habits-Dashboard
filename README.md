Project Overview:
The Spotify Streaming Habits Dashboard was built to analyze and visualize a user's music streaming history. The dataset includes details like playtime, artists, tracks, albums, and reasons for playing or stopping music. Using Power BI, interactive visuals were created to showcase user preferences and streaming behavior.

Data Cleaning Steps:
Handling Missing Values: Removed and filled missing values in key columns to avoid gaps in analysis.
Converting Data Types: Adjusted columns like ms_played and timestamps to their appropriate formats.
Removing Duplicates: Eliminated duplicate rows to maintain data consistency.
Standardizing Text Data: Cleaned and formatted text columns ( artist_name, track_name) by removing extra spaces and ensuring uniform case.
Filtering Outliers: Excluded tracks with negligible playtime (ms_played close to zero) to focus on meaningful data

Insights and Features:
Key Numbers:
Total Tracks Played: 745,000
Total Minutes Played: 317,320
Unique Artists: 4,078
Unique Albums: 7,839
Visuals and Insights:

Bar Charts: Most-played tracks by day of the week, with Friday being the most popular day for streaming.
Reason Analysis: Most tracks ended naturally, with 76,000 completions, and interruptions were minimal.
Line and Donut Charts: Show how and why users started or stopped playing music.

This project provides a clear understanding of user listening habits, popular content, and peak streaming times, offering valuable insights for enhancing user experience on Spotify.
